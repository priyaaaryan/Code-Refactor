# Code-Refactor   
I updated the code as per the following criteria:
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
